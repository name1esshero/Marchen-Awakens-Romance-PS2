## Section names survive removal of the symbol table

Symptom: ELF has no SHT_SYMTAB but thousands of named sections.
Mechanism: GNU linkonce section names can preserve method/type spellings separately
from symbol tables. Inspect the section-string table before treating all code as anonymous.
Evidence: this boot ELF has 2,251 sections, including named CCamera accessors.
Verification: Python inventory, GNU readelf and LLVM disassembly agree on the selected
sections; eight accessor sections reassemble to the same 64 bytes.
Scope: this single ELF and these eight standard MIPS sequences with Clang 21.1.8.
Limits: section names do not prove original signatures, class layout, compiler version,
or boundaries inside the main `.text`; do not generalize assembler support to R5900.
